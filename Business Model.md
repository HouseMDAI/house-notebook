# Business Model

Choose any:
- SaaS: monthly/annual subscription
- Pay per use (e.g. 1$ per request)
- B2B with hospitals providers (usage by doctors, payment by business)
- B2B with hospitals or medical insurance company: the app becomes part of the service package (usage by customers, payment by business)
- Partnerships with healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies, or health-related brands. Offer sponsored content, promotions, or exclusive offers within the app in exchange for financial support or revenue sharing.
- Sponsorship by health-related companies, nonprofit, or government (difficult but possible)
