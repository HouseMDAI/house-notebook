1. **Do you think you visit doctors often enough?**

   - Not enough for sure.

2. **Were there cases when it seemed necessary, but there was no desire?**

   - Yes, a few times.

3. **Is it always obvious to you whether you need to visit a doctor or is everything normal?**

   - In most cases, it is.

4. **Why don't you go often enough?**

   - I have no time, no desire, it’s confusing.

5. **In such cases, would you agree to use an application with an AI doctor instead of a real hospital?**

   - I would definitely try.

6. **In this case, the application will need your medical history. Will you trust all your medical data in every detail?**

   - I think yes.

7. **Okay, there is some history, now the doc can diagnose you based on your symptoms and give advice. Will you trust it?**

   - Trust? No. I don't trust anyone completely.

8. **Now you've got some advice from the app. What's next?**

   - I read it, maybe I’ll listen and definitely go check with a real doctor.

9. **What if there is a similar application, not a diagnostician, but a psychotherapist-coach?**

   - There is more trust here. It's like less dangerous.

10. **Will you use it regularly for a long time? (At least a year)**

    - Depending on how well it suits me. Can't tell until I try.

11. **Will you trust the empathy, support, and motivation from the app?**

    - Hardly to sympathy. The rest is possible

12. **What does this depend on?**

    - How much the advice will help.

1. **I know you don’t really like visiting doctors, even when necessary. In such cases, would you agree to use an application with an AI doctor instead of a human?**

   - In Germany - 1000000% yes. If you don’t have to make an appointment with AI and wait 2 weeks for it. Now I literally live from doctor to doctor.

2. **In this case, the application will need your medical history. Will you trust all your medical data in every detail?**

   - Yes, sure thing. I don’t care, even though there’s an app with tarot spreads for health, if it helps, I’ll also send them photos.

3. **Great. There is a history, now the doc can diagnose you based on your symptoms and give advice. Will you trust them?**

   - Good question. If "doc" is not a ChatGPT with frills, then more, of course, but I would be on the safe side somehow... Is this whole story paid? I would trust something paid more. Maybe it would be possible to buy a doctor’s consultation directly inside the app, but maybe this is stupid, because it negates the entire concept. If you identify chickenpox or ARVI, it’s calm, but cancer may not be tracked by itself, and the AI will not detect it. These are more questions for AI now, plus it depends on the seriousness of the medical case.

4. **What if there is a similar application, not a diagnostician, but a psychotherapist-coach?**
   - I think it’s better for the therapist to be a person. At least in this time period with currently existing technologies. In therapy, empathy is very necessary and important.
